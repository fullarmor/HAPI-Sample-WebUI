# HAPI-Sample-WebUI
Sample WebUI demonstrating the use of HAPI APIs

The Web UI provides a sample integration into any browser based application using HAPI to authenticate and interact with files from that application. Unlike the other sample apps, the Web UI demonstrates more functionality. It deals with shared files, goes beyond just Active Directory (AD) files to Box and Dropbox files as well, and supports file and folder copy and sync jobs.
